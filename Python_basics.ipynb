        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "-> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its\n",
        "   simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "   Python is popular beacuse of the following points :\n",
        "   a. Easy to Learn and Use\n",
        "   b. Versatile and Multi-Paradigm:\n",
        "      Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their projects.\n",
        "   c. Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:\n",
        "      Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as:\n",
        "      Numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Tenserflow, Pytorch, flask and django\n",
        "   d. Strong Community Support\n",
        "   e.  Cross-Platform Compatibility\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "-> An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by  \n",
        "   line, translating it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "   Python's interpreter directly processes the code, making development faster and more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "-> Predefined keywords (reserved words) in Python are special words that have a\n",
        "   fixed meaning in the language and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "   These keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs.\n",
        "   E.g - None, is, in, True, False, import, return, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "-> No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Since keywords have\n",
        "   predefined meanings in the language, using them as variable names would cause syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "-> Mutability in python refers to whether an object can be modified after its   creation.\n",
        "   When an object is mutable, its data can be changed in place without altering its memory address. However, for immutable objects, any change creates a new object in memory rather than modifying the original one.\n",
        "   Mutable objects allow modifications after they are created. These modifications can occur without changing the object's memory address.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "-> a. Lists are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic. Python allows\n",
        "   elements to be added, removed, or changed without changing the memory address.\n",
        "   Lists store references to objects in a resizable array, allowing modifications.\n",
        "   b. Tuples are immutable because they are meant to be static. Once created, their elements cannot be changed, making them memory-efficient and faster.\n",
        "   Tuples store references in a fixed structure, preventing changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "-> a. \"==\" operator (equality operator)\n",
        "     Compares the contents of two objects.\n",
        "     Checks if values are the same (regardless of memory location).\n",
        "     \"==\" operator is used for comparing values.\n",
        "   b. \"is\" operator (Identity Operator)\n",
        "      Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory (i.e., memory address comparison).\n",
        "      \"is\" operator checks if two variables reference the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "-> Logical operators in Python are operators that combine multiple conditions\n",
        "   and return a boolean value (True or False) based on logical relationships.\n",
        "   Python has three logical operators:\n",
        "   and → Returns True if both conditions are True.\n",
        "   or → Returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
        "   not → Reverses the boolean value of a condition (True becomes False and vice versa).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "-> Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into\n",
        "   another.\n",
        "   It can be done in two ways:\n",
        "   a. Explicit Type Casting (Manual) → Using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "   b. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic) → Python automatically converts types when no data loss occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "-> a. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Conversion):\n",
        "      Implicit Type Casting (automatic type conversion) is the process where Python automatically converts one data type into another without explicit intervention from the programmer.\n",
        "      This usually happens when converting a smaller data type (like int) into a larger one (like float) to avoid data loss.\n",
        "      Implicit type casting allows Python to handle different data types efficiently without risking data loss.\n",
        "      Python does not implicitly convert types if there’s a risk of losing information.\n",
        "   b. Explicit Type Casting :\n",
        "      Explicit Type Casting (manual type conversion) is when a programmer manually converts one data type into another using built-in functions. This is necessary when Python does not perform automatic conversion (implicit casting) due to the risk of data loss or incompatibility.\n",
        "       It allows programmers to control conversions and handle incompatible data types manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "-> Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of  \n",
        "   code based on conditions.\n",
        "   They allow the program to make decisions and control the flow of execution.\n",
        "   Purpose of conditional statements -\n",
        "   a. Decision Making - Execute specific code only if a condition is met.\n",
        "   b. Control Flow -  Direct the program to follow different paths based on\n",
        "      conditions.\n",
        "   c. Code Efficiency - Avoid unnecessary execution of code blocks.\n",
        "   d. Implementing Logic -  Used in loops, functions, and algorithms for  \n",
        "      dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "-> The elif statement in Python is used for multi-way decision-making. It\n",
        "   allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute the first block of code where the condition evaluates to True.\n",
        "   elif statement workflow -\n",
        "   a. The if statement is checked first.\n",
        "   b. If if is True, its block executes, and the rest of the elif and else\n",
        "      blocks are skipped.\n",
        "   c. If if is False, Python checks the first elif condition.\n",
        "   d. If an elif condition is True, its block executes, and Python skips the\n",
        "      rest.\n",
        "   e. If none of the conditions are True, the else block (if provided) runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "-> a. For loop -\n",
        "      A for loop is used when you know how many times you need to iterate. It is commonly used with sequences like lists, tuples, strings, or range().\n",
        "      Use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run (e.g., looping over a list, range(), or a string).\n",
        "   b. While loop -\n",
        "      A while loop is used when you don’t know how many times you need to iterate in advance. It runs as long as a certain condition remains True.\n",
        "      Use a while loop when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run (e.g., waiting for user input, checking a condition that may change).\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "-> A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations\n",
        "   is not known in advance and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        "   Scenario: User Input Validation -\n",
        "   Imagine you are creating a program that asks a user to enter a password. You want the program to keep asking for the correct password until the user enters it correctly. In this case, a while loop is more suitable because you dont know how many attempts the user will need."
